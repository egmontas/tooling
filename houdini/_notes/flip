Volume Loss

flipobject:

    properties
        the mass of particles is volume*density therefore changing particle separation will change particle mass
        grid scale - if grid scale goes below a threshold, new particles are spawned (a kind of over-compensated-sampling)
        
    creation

    initial data
        sop path
        initialise velocity, viscosity & temp
    guides
        particles - set to particles not sprites
        collision - true collision resolution that the simulation sees
    physical
    collisions

    substeps

    particle motion
    volume motion
        velocity transfer - splash for water, swirly for art directing fluids
        volume limits - adjust bounding box
        collisions - 
    narrow band
    distribution
